# Laravel Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to have a working API in Laravel.

The request is to make a simple Todo manager (only the API, no frontend).

The basic requirements are that a user can make projects and create todo’s in the project. A project can have multiple todo’s, every todo has 1 project and is tied to 1 user.

These are the requirements:
```
Project
	- a project can be created
		- a project has a name
		- a project can have multiple todos
	- a list of projects can be viewed
```
```
Todo
- a todo can be created
- a todo has a description
- a todo can have 2 states - “Todo” and “Done”
- a todo is related to 1 project
- a todo is owned by 1 user
- a todo keeps track of how many times its viewed (simple counter)
- a todo can be marked as done
- a todo can be deleted
- a todo can be viewed
- a list of todos can be viewed
```


The source code can be shared through a github/gitlab link or a zipfile.
